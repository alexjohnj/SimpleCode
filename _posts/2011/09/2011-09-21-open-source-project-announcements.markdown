This is a small set of announcements regarding several of my open source projects. It doesn't have anything to do with the tutorials I write on this blog so if you don't follow my open source projects, feel free to skip this post.

### GitHub

Several weeks ago I began using the git version control system for the SimpleCalc project. Just recently, I've also started using it for SimpleQuad too. As a result of this transfer to git (and the awesomeness of git), it's now possible for me to make the source code for SimpleCalc and SimpleQuad available through GitHub. Future versions of SimpleCalc's and SimpleQuad's source code will be available exclusively through GitHub and I will no longer be providing a zip file through Google Code containing the source code. The source code available through GitHub will be the latest source code for unreleased versions of SimpleCalc and SimpleQuad. In addition, downloads for precompiled versions of SimpleCalc & SimpleQuad will also be available through GitHub. Precompiled versions will remain available through Google Code too. The links to the GitHub projects are below:

## Deprecated Projects

Unfortunately, I'm deprecating two of my other projects and no longer actively developing them. SimpleCalc++ will no longer be actively developed. The main reason for this is that I started the application when I thought I'd be programming with C++ as my main language but things turned out differently and I don't program in C++, making active development and maintenance of this application slightly challenging for me. As a result, I shall no longer work on SimpleCalc++. DifferentiateMe is also being deprecated and development is being stopped for it too. This is due to the fact that there are no more features to add to DifferentiateMe due to the simple nature of the application. 

## Development Slowdown

The development of SimpleCalc is going to be slowed over the coming months. There will be no more major updates to SimpleCalc and I will only be providing bug fixes, minor improvements and translations of the application. SimpleCalc has run its course and by the end of the year, I probably will be no longer actively working on the project. The same is true for SimpleQuad for which I hope to stop development on by the end of this year. Of course I'm going to keep on developing and hope to start working on a far more interesting (and challenging) project soon. 

## Wrap Up

To summarise what I just told you:

- [SimpleCalc's](https://github.com/alexjohnj/SimpleCalc) & [SimpleQuad's](https://github.com/alexjohnj/SimpleQuad) source code is now available through GitHub.
- SimpleCalc++ & DifferentiateMe are no longer being worked on. 
- Development of SimpleCalc and SimpleQuad is being slowed and development on the two projects will be stopped by the end of the year. 
- I'll be starting one (or more) new projects fairly soon.
