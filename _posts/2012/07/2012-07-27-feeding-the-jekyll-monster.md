title: "Feeding the Jekyll Monster"
excerpt: "Things look different, again. At the start of the year I converted this website from a dynamic Wordpress blog to a static Octopress blog. Now I’ve taken it one step further and converted the website to a static Jekyll powered website. It’s really awesome. Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. Octopress itself is powered by it. I just feed the Jekyll monster with a template and some Markdown files and out pops a new website directory which I can push to any web host."

Things look different, again. At the start of the year I converted this website from a dynamic Wordpress blog to a static Octopress blog. Now I’ve taken it one step further and converted the website to a static Jekyll powered website. It’s really awesome. Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. Octopress itself is powered by it. I just feed the Jekyll monster with a template and some Markdown files and out pops a new website directory which I can push to any web host. 

The really cool thing with Jekyll is that it’s made by people from GitHub, so they’ve gone ahead and integrated GitHub with Jekyll. GitHub Pages, a free static site hosting service provided by GitHub, is powered by Jekyll, so instead of having to generate the website on my local machine, I can just push the git repository to GitHub and it’ll generate a new website. I’ve been doing this for months with [another](http://geographyas.info) website I run and the workflow I’ve developed is fantastic. 

Hosting on GitHub pages is fantastic but has a few limitations, mainly a lack of support for Jekyll plugins. It makes sense, I doubt the GitHub team wants arbitrary code running on their servers, but it is frustrating since a blog built without plugins will be a little bit limited. Non the less, I’ve tried to work around this limitation for SimpleCode and, while it ain’t pretty in some places, it gets the job done. 

Since the website is hosted on GitHub, it’s open source, so feel free to contribute to the website. You can file issues over any mistakes on the website and even initiate pull requests if you’re so inclined. You can get the source code [here](https://github.com/alexjohnj/simplecode). 

The new website isn’t totally complete. There’s a few, non mission critical, features missing from it. It’s no longer a responsive website for example. I’ll fix these over the months but, obviously, you can read posts on the website without trouble.
